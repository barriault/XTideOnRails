<p><strong>I only have one requirement for using this webservice. Please do not modify, hide, or 
remove the table's footer which includes a link back to the Prime Fishing Times
website. Think of this as sort of an enhanced link exchange program. You receive
free tide data for your site in exchange for links back to my site. It's a win/win
situation for both of us.</strong></p>

<p>The Prime Fishing Times webservice is a very simple interface that returns 
an XHTML table of today's tide data for a particular location. To use the
webservice go to the <a href="<%= url_for :controller => 'locations' %>">Locations</a> 
page to find the ID of the location you want. The ID is the last part of the URL
for the Show link.</p>

<p>For instance, the Show link for San Luis Pass, Texas is 
<a href="http://primefishingtimes.com/home/tides/2721">http://primefishingtimes.com/home/tides/2721</a>. 
The webservice can be accessed using the ID, 2721, with a link to
<a href="http://primefishingtimes.com/webservice/tides/2721">http://primefishingtimes.com/webservice/tides/2721</a>.
If you enter an invalid ID, the webservice will return a table with an empty body
and a header that says <strong>ERROR: Invalid location ID.</strong></p>

<p>If you're using <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> like I do for my 
<a href="http://barriault.net">personal blog</a>, you can use PHP code like this:</p>

<pre>
&lt;?php
require_once(ABSPATH . WPINC . '/class-snoopy.php');
 
	$snoopy = new Snoopy;
	
	$snoopy->fetch(&quote;http://primefishingtimes.com/webservice/tides/2721&quote;);
	echo $snoopy-&gt;results;
?&gt;

</pre>
